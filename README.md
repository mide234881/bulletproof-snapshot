# Bulletproof Snapshot ðŸ“¸

A decentralized snapshot management system for secure and transparent data tracking on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

Bulletproof Snapshot is an innovative blockchain-based solution for creating, managing, and verifying data snapshots with unparalleled security and integrity. By leveraging Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain, the platform provides a robust mechanism for capturing, storing, and retrieving immutable data representations.

## Core Features

- Immutable snapshot creation and management
- Cryptographically secure data verification
- Multi-type snapshot support (document, metadata, state)
- Transparent tracking and auditing
- Decentralized storage and retrieval
- Fine-grained access control

## Architecture

The platform consists of three main smart contracts that work together:

### 1. Snapshot Registry (`snapshot-registry`)
- Core contract for managing snapshot records
- Handles snapshot creation, validation, and tracking
- Maintains comprehensive snapshot history
- Supports multiple snapshot types and metadata

### 2. Snapshot Verifier (`snapshot-verifier`)
- Handles cryptographic verification of snapshots
- Implements robust integrity checks
- Manages verification workflows and proofs
- Supports multi-signature and consensus-based verification

### 3. Snapshot Access Controller (`snapshot-access`)
- Manages access permissions for snapshots
- Implements role-based access control
- Tracks and logs access attempts
- Supports granular permission management

## Smart Contract Functions

### Snapshot Management
```clarity
;; Create a new snapshot
(create-snapshot 
  (snapshot-type (string-ascii 50))
  (data-hash (buff 32))
  (metadata (string-ascii 500)))

;; Update snapshot metadata
(update-snapshot-metadata
  (snapshot-id uint)
  (new-metadata (string-ascii 500)))

;; Verify snapshot integrity
(verify-snapshot
  (snapshot-id uint)
  (verification-proof (buff 32)))
```

### Snapshot Access Control
```clarity
;; Grant access to a snapshot
(grant-snapshot-access 
  (snapshot-id uint)
  (user principal)
  (access-level uint))

;; Revoke snapshot access
(revoke-snapshot-access
  (snapshot-id uint)
  (user principal))

;; Check snapshot access permissions
(has-snapshot-access
  (snapshot-id uint)
  (user principal))
```

### Snapshot Verification
```clarity
;; Generate cryptographic proof
(generate-snapshot-proof (snapshot-id uint))

;; Validate snapshot against stored proof
(validate-snapshot-proof 
  (snapshot-id uint)
  (proof (buff 32)))
```

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the smart contracts in the following order:
   - `snapshot-registry`
   - `snapshot-verifier`
   - `snapshot-access`

2. Create an initial snapshot:
```clarity
(contract-call? snapshot-registry create-snapshot 
  "document-snapshot"
  0x1234567890abcdef
  "Initial project documentation")
```

3. Verify snapshot integrity:
```clarity
(contract-call? snapshot-verifier verify-snapshot
  u1
  0xabcdef1234567890)
```

## Security Considerations

- All contracts implement proper authorization checks
- Payment thresholds and approval workflows prevent unauthorized spending
- Historical records are maintained for auditing
- Status changes are tracked and verified
- Multi-step processes for critical operations

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with recommendation engines
- Advanced spending optimization algorithms
- Additional payment token support
- Enhanced analytics features
- Social features for subscription sharing
